    <h1>Panic.com Review</h1>
    <p>I like the way the website is set up. It is very easy to navigate and it is not too text heavy. I like the zoomed in pictures of the different app features. That combined with the short snippets of text explaining the pictures keeps you from getting overwhelmed by the amount of information on the page. They are very enthusiast about the products they are presenting and make it very clear that they are willing and wan to help you with anything that you do not understand.

    There are a few things that they could improve on however. I think they could make each page a little more consistent.  Where information and help is located on each page seems a little different. Maybe try the help menu at the bottom of the main page, even if it is a smaller version or a little different, at the bottom of ever page. At least I would put the symbols in the footer on each page. Other than that I did not have any trouble finding my way around on the site, but I did find myself having to go back to the main page a lot for navigation. It would be nice if the other pages had more navigation, possibly in the footer.
