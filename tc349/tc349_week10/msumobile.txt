The home page of the site is set up very straight forward and is very easy to navigate to all the different parts of the website. All of the picture icons are easy to see and big enough that they can all be selected easily. The menu for each of the other pages is set up nicely with in a bar format with the links large enough and having just enough content so you know what you are navigating to. When I turn the phone on its side the screen adjusts nicely and makes the lists of links a lot bigger if you do have trouble seeing or clicking on them.
It nice that there is a link at the bottom of every page to take you back to the home page so you can easily get to a new page. Another nice feature is the customize home page. It is a nice feature to be able to choose to get rid of some of the icons if you know you wont need them and it is a very simple customization option. The video page is set up consistent with the rest of the site and it is easy to navigate to and watch videos. Overall not only does the site look really good it is very practical and easy to use on a mobile device. I had no issues finding my way around and using this site.
