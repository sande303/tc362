	I have not had much trouble with this site and can usually find what I am looking for. I like the layout and look of the site, but the problem is the amount of information that this website has to try and cover. It is very easy to get lost on this site because of the amount of navigation on each page. I specifically have always had trouble navigating my way to the student advising that I need to go to because sometimes it will take you to a website about the field of study or about the major in general.

I also know people that have had trouble with the faculty and staff verses students and which one they need to use because they fall in both categories. The website looks nice but I feel like unless you are pretty sure on what you are looking for you are going to have a hard time finding the answer you want. I am not really sure how to fix this problem because it is a lot of information on the site. They do have a lot of different ways to search the site thought which helps fix the problem some because if you can't find what you are looking for you can try a different method of searching.
