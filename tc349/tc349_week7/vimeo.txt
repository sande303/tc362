	The how page is pretty cool and friendly. There is a lot of helpful information on this page that tells you everything that you would need to know about this site. I like the gird set up for the part of the first page that tells you about each feature of the site. After looking around for a little I set up an account to see how the site worked. There is a lot of information on right after you set up an account and it is a little overwhelming. After getting used to the page I noticed a layout selection for how the videos are displayed on the page. This is a good feature because it lets you customize how you view the site. I personally like the third option the best because the video thumb is not too big and it gives a description with likes and plays.
 	The site overall seems like it is geared more towards the people who make the videos and gives them a way to do it. Unlike YouTube the seem to be more about people producing higher quality content and allowing the people that make the videos a way to make money. The site makes it very east to publish videos. 
	I like the way the about Vimeo page is set up too. I like the grid portrait set up for the staff pictures. It is nice to see an about page and what each of them likes on Vimeo to get to know the staff. If you were looking to get a job here it is always nice to be able to research your employers and get to know them first, which this part of the site really does. Overall all of the pages are set up pretty consistent and nothing is really hard to find. The way the site is set up though if you just want to browse viral videos and that is the only purpose I would probably still just use YouTube.
