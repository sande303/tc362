I like the look of the website because there is not a lot of clutter or unnecessary stuff that makes the site distracting. The one major critique that I have about the site is the information at the bottom of each page seems like a lot to have on every page. I think the footer could be compressed taking out some of the stuff that is covered thoroughly elsewhere on the site, such as the "on the subject of me" and "A book apart". Both of those are covered right off of the main navigation. Other than that all of the colors and fonts flow nicely and I like the use of dating the articles so the viewer knows how old the information is.
