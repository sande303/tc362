Weed Problem	 	Chemical	 	Pounds Active Ingredient (AI)/Acre	 	Amount of Commercial Product/Acre	 	Remarks and Limitations
Items in bold have changed since the printed bulletin.
Emerged weeds before crop emergence	 	paraquat
(GRAMOXONE INTEON 2L)	 	0.5	 	
2 pt	 	Apply before seeding or transplanting cucumbers to kill emerged weeds. Include 1 pt NIS/100 gal. RUP.
Preemergence annuals	 	bensulide
(PREFAR 4E)	 	4-6	 	
4-6 qt	 	Apply and incorporate 0.5-1 inch before seeding or transplanting. Controls many annual grasses. May stunt crop if used under clear plastic.
 	clomazone
(COMMAND 3ME)	 	0.25-0.375	 	
0.67-1 pt	 	Apply to soil surface after seeding. If replanting after poor stand, do not reapply Command. Good control of velvetleaf. Observe rotational restrictions. Small grains are sensitive to carryover. 45-day PHI.
 	ethalfluralin
(CURBIT 3E)	 	0.75-1.13	 	
2-3 pt	 	DIRECT-SEEDED CUCUMBERS. Use low rate on sandy soil. Apply to surface after seeding. Do not incorporate. Needs 0.5 inch of water within 5 days to activate it. Heavy rainfall may result in crop injury. 
TRANSPLANTED CUCUMBERS: Apply to soil between rows of plastic mulch. Do not apply over or under hotcaps, row covers or plastic mulch. Do not apply over the top of transplants.
 	ethalfluralin+
clomazone
(STRATEGY 2.1L)	 	0.6-1.2+
0.19-0.375	 	

3-6 pt	 	Apply to soil surface after seeding, or as a banded spray between rows after transplanting. Needs 0.5 inch water within 2 days for activation.
 	s-metolachlor
(DUAL MAGNUM 7.62 EC)	 	0.64 - 0.95	 	
0.67 - 1 pt	 	Apply after seeding or after the 1 true leaf stage for nutsedge and nightshade control. Use low rate on light soils. Dual Magnum may reduce emergence and stunt growth. Do not mix with other pesticides or adjuvants for postemergence application. Max. 1 pt/a/yr. 30 day PHI. See: www.farmassist.com to obtain SLN label.
 	trifluralin
(TREFLAN 4E)	 	1-2	 	
1-2 qt	 	Direct the spray between rows of plants with 3-4 leaves. Cultivate shallowly to incorporate. Avoid contact with crop leaves. 30-day PHI.
Preemergence and postemergence broadleaves	 	halosulfuron
(SANDEA 75W)	 	0.023-0.047	 	
0.5-1 oz	 	PREEMERGENCE: Apply after seeding but before cracking. Use low rate on light soils. Heavy rain and cool temperatures cause crop injury. 
POSTEMERGENCE: Apply when crop has 3-5 leaves and before flowering. Include 0.25% NIS. Controls nutsedge. ROW MIDDLES: Apply to area between rows of plastic. UNDER PLASTIC: Apply just before laying plastic. Wait 7 days to plant. Use low rate. OVER PLASTIC: Use spot treatment for nutsedge control. Observe rotational restrictions. Carryover can injure sugarbeets. 30-day PHI.
Postemergence grasses	 	clethodim
(SELECT MAX 0.97E)	 	0.068-0.12	 	
9-16 fl oz	 	Apply to actively growing grasses. Maximum 64 fl oz/acre/year. Include 0.25% NIS/acre. 14-day PHI.
 	sethoxydim
(POAST 1.5E)	 	0.19-0.28	 	
1-1.5 pt	 	Apply to actively growing grasses. Include 1 qt COC/acre. Maximum total of 3 pt/acre/season. 14-day PHI.
Postemergence weeds	 	paraquat
(GRAMOXONE INTEON 2L)	 	0.5	 	
2 pt	 	Use shields to protect crop. Apply in 20-30 gal water/acre. Do not exceed 30 PSI pressure. Do not allow spray to contact crop foliage. Maximum 3 applications per year. RUP. 8-day PHI.
Emerged perennials	 	glyphosate
(ROUNDUP 4L)	 	2-3	 	
2-3 qt	 	Apply to emerged perennials before planting the crop. Wait 3 days before planting.</p>
