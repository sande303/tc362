<h1>About Myself</h1>
</header>
<section>
<p>I like hanging out with friends, playing games, listening to music and having a good time. On this site are a couple of my hobbies and some favorites within each catagory to give an idea of what I like. I also like learning new computer languages so I can create and do new things on my computer.</p>

<h2>Where I'm from</h2>
</header>
<section>
<p>I was born in Mount Clemens Michigan and grew up in Clinton Township. I went to high school at Lutheran High North. I played football for two years and wrestled for all four years that I was there. After High school we moved to Linwood Michigan, a small town just North of Bay City. This is when I moved to East Lansing for school at Michigan State. It is good to be a Spartan!</p>
