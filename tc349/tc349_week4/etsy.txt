The first thing that I notice about this website is the amount of pictures and navigation on the site. Almost everything on the page can be clicked on to take you to a new place and I can see it being a little bit overwhelming. However it is pretty easy to tell what is the main navigation and what takes you to a new site. I do like the pictures t add substance to the page and the box structure looks nice. 
The web site looks like a standard for a lot of heavily merchandise based sites, where there is a lot of pictures of what there is to buy that you can click on for more information. There is a pretty standard search by category set of links along the side. I think it would be nice if this was on the other pages to make it easier to change what you are looking for. I had no problem navigating the site though and I like that they have plenty of links to let them know what you think and other places you can find them on the web.
