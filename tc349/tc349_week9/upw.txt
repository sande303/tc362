I like the navigation on the United Pixelworkers site. The grid layout really works good on a site like this too because you can compare different items and there is a picture to preview each item before you decide if you want moor details. When you do go to look at a shirt I like the zoom in as you mouse over a shirt to get an even closer look. This page also makes picking a shirt size and adding it to you cart very easy, and straightforward which is always good to make it easy for you to purchase something on a site.
All of the other pages are set up similarly, which is good for getting comfortable with the site. The pages with text like the Blog and About pages are both simple one column layouts that look nice and do not need to be any more complicated. The Podcast and Jobs pages both have a similar list style layout with dates so you know when stuff is happening or has happened and it is organized well. The only real issue that I had when navigating this site is that when you go to collection or Pixelivery pages there are only three links at the top and none of them take you back to the home page. After searching around for a while I had to just go back until I got to the homepage, which was kind of frustrating.
