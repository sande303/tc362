<p>I decided to do an open sort for my sorts because I felt it would not change much at all if I did a closed sort. The first sort is the sort that I did and it was not too far off from the actual site in that most of the items were still linked in similar ways as on the Foldable.me site. One of the biggest differences that I had from the site was that I had a lot more of the links connected to the create part of the site. For example I had the share and Blog both in the link to create because I felt that you should be able to post creations to the blog or share them on facebook or twitter directly from the create. I organized the about, services, and brands pages all at about the same level of importance possibly as a link on the side of the page and the contact and terms/services pages at the bottom in the footer. </p>
<p>The next sort on the page is one I had my roommate do. He has the home at the top to show that you can get anywhere from here. Then he put what he thought was a main link above a group of content that he thought belonged within that link. The top row (create, login, and Basket at the top and the other links at the bottom of the page. Some of the content got put under different links in his sort like the gift cards and brands. </p>
<p>There was not really anyone else around so I could only do the two sorts.</p>
