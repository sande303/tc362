	The first thing I noticed on this site was the bar across the top that comes with you when you try scrolling down. I do not like when websites do this because it takes up so much of the screen making it hard to see a full portion of the web page without scrolling up and down. The next thing that I noticed is all of the stuff moving around in the background. The updating stats are kind of cool and it is a good way to show off what they are doing, but I would not have the symbols in the background move as you scroll because it is distracting. 
	I really like the who are we page. Having the pictures of everyone and linking them to where they fit in is really good and the way they do it is awesome. Having the list of positions on the side and when you hover over it shows only the people in those positions is a really fun and cool way to go about it and it is very smooth. The come work with us page is very professional and the on page navigation bar on the side is nice for finding key areas on the page. The Labs page is set up cool with the hover over zoom on the picture links, but the text tends to meet in the middle making it a little confusing to read, so maybe a divider or just more space between sides would be nice. The login is nice to have on every page in the same spot and the help pages look easy to use and very helpful. I really like the interactivity on this website and over all it looks fun and easy to use.
