<h1>Final Project Card Sort</h1>

<p>The image of the first sort is the one that I did. I have the home card at the top to be the home page where you can go to either Bay View Foods, or Mr. Chips Inc.  The middle set of cards going down will be on both pages with an about page as the home for each. Then there is the products page that will be in each companyâ€™s link, with the contents of that page off to each side respectively. Finally there is a page that tells how their product is made and what makes them so great. The three other main links underneath that will be at the bottom of the page, with one for links, contacts, and suppliers, and the information for each grouped underneath to show it is on that page.</p>
<p>The second image is a sort that my roommate did. He also put the home at the top to show it was the beginning or top of the site. He then put the two different parts of the company  and grouped a lot more information into those links than I did in my sort. His idea was to have all the main content grouped onto either page or the other with on-page navigation to locate the different parts of the site. The links are at the bottom as part of the footer and the better pickles is another main link that applies to both parts of the company.</p>
