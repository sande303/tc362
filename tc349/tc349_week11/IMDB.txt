	IMDB is a site that I use all the time to look up an actor that I recognize, but I can't figure out where I have seen him or what I have seen them in. The mobile site I have found works just as good as the regular site. The top of the screen is a search bar that extends the length of the screen and is very important for using this site. When you start to search there is a drop down with suggestions, with names and a picture very much like the regular site. It is very easy to use and see every thing on the site which is very important for a mobile site. It is also nice and helpful that it looks and feels very much like the regular site so that I can easily adapt and use the mobile site as easy as the regular site. 
	All of the links on the page are set up nicely in a list format, usually with a picture to make it easier to identify who or what you are looking for. The images you can also click on to increase to the size of the screen to make them easier to see. The biography paragraphs wrap nicely and are easy to read. Also all of the headings on the pages separate the texts and links nicely so you can easily view one part at a time and know what you are looking at. There is also a footer on the page with options for changing the size of the text if you are having trouble reading the text. The footing also has options for switching between movies, tv, celebs, etc. Overall I like the mobile site just as much as the regular site it is a well adapted website.
