The happy cog website gives you a lot of information on the homepage. I would like the site a lot better if the links took you to different pages rather than different spots on the same home page. This feature makes it kind of difficult to navigate to other parts of the site if you are not on the home page. The contact at the bottom of each page is also very large and could easily be its own page because that information is not really that important that you need it taking up the whole screen on each page. 

I do like the set up of there blog. It is nice and clean and easy to navigate. The related topics helps to find similar blogs and I also like the pictures and names along the side of who wrote the article. The consistency of the site overall is pretty good. It all feels like the same website and each page has similar navigation, but it is still kind of confusing if it is going to take you to a spot on the same page or a new page when you click on a lot of the links.
